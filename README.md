# CM — macOS Camera Utility

CM is an experimental macOS utility that uses DriverKit and Apple’s Camera Extension framework to build a virtual camera with overlay support.

This project is built using:
- SwiftUI for the main app UI
- SystemExtension + Camera Extension (CMIOExtension)
- DriverKit for virtual camera exposure

The goal is to explore camera interface capabilities on modern macOS using entirely sandbox-safe, notarizable components.
